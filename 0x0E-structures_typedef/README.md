Besides functions you can also write documentation for structs, unions, enums and typedefs.

Instead of the function name you must write the name of the declaration;

the struct/union/enum/typedef must always precede the name. Nesting of declarations is not supported.

Use the argument mechanism to document members or constants.



Example:



/**

 * struct my_struct - Short description

 * @a: First member

 * @b: Second member

 * @c: Third member

 *

 * Description: Longer description

 */

struct my_struct

{

	int a;

	int b;

	int c;

};

For really longs structs, you can also describe arguments inside the body of the struct.



Example:



/**

 * struct my_struct - Short description

 * @a: First member

 * @b: Second member

 *

 * Description: Longer description

 */

struct my_struct

{

	int a;

	int b;

	/**

	 * @c: This is longer description of C

	 *

	 * Description: You can use paragraphs to describe arguments

	 * using this method.

	 */

	int c;

};

This should be use only for struct/enum members.



Example for a typedef:



/**

 * u_int - Typedef for unsigned int

 */

typedef unsigned int u_int;

Of course, you're free to add the Description header on any documentation block.
